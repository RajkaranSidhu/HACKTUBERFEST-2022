Having very low understandnig of the Prototypes's use
The Object.create() method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.

what does it means by “prototype of the newly created object” .

and what are the cases this is usefull?

SOURCE=> MDN JS DOCS

const obj= {a:1,b:2}
const obj2= {name:'Qaisar',}
const temp= Object.create(obj)
temp.name='Qaisar'
obj.a=9
console.log(temp,'temp', obj,'OBJECT')
MDN Docs says Object.create gives a shallow copy but nothing gets copied here
