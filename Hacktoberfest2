timeit on a python file that launches pytest
I would like to timeit a python file, but I can't make it work: the python file looks like it (it launches tests)

import pytest
import sys

retcode: int | pytest.ExitCode = pytest.main(["--mypy", "--ignore=viewers"])

if retcode == pytest.ExitCode.OK:
    print(f"\n---\nYou are using Python {sys.version} btw\n---\n")
I've tried python -m timeit unit_tests.py with quotes around the unit_tests.py and without extension, and all sort of combinaisons but nothing works
